In your browser's console, you may see the following error:
> RangeError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Out of memory: wasm memory

When too much memory is allocated to browser processes, browsers will run out of memory. This can happen if you open too many Qi X Lab projects at the same time. This includes our editor, RESEARCH IDE, and Web Publisher - or if a page features too many Qi X Lab embeds running at the same time.

**To free up memory, close other Qi X Lab projects in other tabs or windows, and refresh the page.**
