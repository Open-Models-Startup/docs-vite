:::warning Note: Qi X Lab RESEARCH is currently in Beta

:::

Qi X Lab now helps you switch contexts seamlessly:

- <!--@include: ./parts/research-ide.md-->
- <!--@include: ./parts/web-publisher.md-->
- <!--@include: ./parts/pr-new.md-->
- <!--@include: ./parts/researchapp-bot.md-->

## Key features

- 🔒 **unmatched security**: all development is happening in your browser tab, including running Node.js, git, package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm), and local extensions.
- ⚡️ **shockingly fast**: the entire dev environment spins up in milliseconds - even reinstalling `node_modules` is as simple as refreshing the page, with pnpm running up to four times as fast as locally!
- 💻 **works online and offline**: continue your work even when you lose the Internet connection midway.
- 🔥 **your environment is always online**: your apps never go to sleep and have no bandwidth limits - share the URL with as many friends, colleagues, and communities as you’d like!
- 🆓 **always free for Open Source**: you're the future of the web development and we love you.

## What about other online IDEs?

Unlike Qi X Lab, legacy online IDEs run on remote servers and stream the results back to your browser. This approach yields **few security benefits** and **provides a worse experience** than your local machine in nearly every way.

**Qi X Lab solves these problems by doing all computing inside your browser**. This leverages decades of speed and security innovations but also **unlocks key development and debugging benefits**.

Lastly, Qi X Lab is capable of running Node.js inside the browser so you can use the web to build the web.
