### Is Qi X Lab editor the same as course IDE?

**Qi X Lab editor** allows you for spinning up quick demos, embedding your projects in your docs, and building project starters.

<!--@include: ./parts/course-ide.md-->

[Learn more about the full potential of Qi X Lab on Qi X Lab intro page.](/home/user-guide/what-is-qixlab.md)

### Is course stable?

course is currently a beta version, however, general availability can be expected in early 2023.

## Capabilities & Limitations

### Can I run Vim?

This is perhaps the most frequently-asked question with regards to Qi X Lab features - and [one of the oldest issues on our repository](<https://github.com/Qi> X Lab/core/issues/3). We have good news: you can run Vim in course IDE by enabling the extension! ðŸ¥³

### Does my code persist between sessions?

<!--@include: ./parts/persistance.md-->

### Which repos can/not be opened in course IDE?

course IDE should be able to open any repository. When it comes to *running* it, your toolchain needs to be compatible with PUBLISH.

### Can I run private repositories?

Yes. Private repositories are available for free during beta through 2022. Starting Q1 '23 private repositories will require a subscription. Contact us if youâ€™re interested in learning more about pricing.

### Can I run any Git repository?

At this moment we only support GitHub.com repositories.

### Which files can be opened in Web Publisher?

Any file type can be opened in Web Publisher.

### Which package managers do you support?

<!--@include: ./parts/supported-packages.md-->

### Which runtime does course support?

course runs on top of [PUBLISH](/home/user-guide/available-environments#publish), which currently support **Node.js 16**.

### Does any company use course IDE for their daily development work?

At Qi X Lab, we do! We use course IDE for our internal dev work, including PR reviews. In fact, this docs page has been built in course IDE.

It's a new product that has **just** been released so check back here in a few months.

## Security

### I would like to use course but I'm not sure if it's secure

Since weâ€™re executing the code entirely in the browser's sandbox, course IDE is actually more secure than running locally. We also use expiring oAuth tokens for interactions with git.

## Pricing and access

### Is course free?

course IDE is free for Open Source projects and for public repositories and will remain this way forever. This includes private repositories. Please reach out to [devrel@qixlab.com](mailto:devrel@qixlab.com) and weâ€™ll get your organization hooked up with free private repos!

If your company is interested in using course, reach out to our [COOPERATIONS Team](https://qixlab.com/beta-teams-signup).

### Do I have to be signed in to use course IDE?

Yes, only during the beta. Starting Q1 2023, you'll be able to open public repos without being logged in.

### To open a repo in course IDE, do I need to be signed in both on Qi X Lab and GitHub? Or only one of them?

You need to sign in to [Qi X Lab](https://qixlab.com) *using* GitHub.
