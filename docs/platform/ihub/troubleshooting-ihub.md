## Cannot load native addon

Currently, iHub can only execute languages that are natively supported on the Web, including JavaScript and WebAssembly. It is not possible to run [native addons](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) which are usually implemented using native languages such as C++, unless they can be compiled to WebAssembly. Therefore, loading native addons is disabled by default via [`--no-addons`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--no-addons) in iHub. As a result, you may encounter an error that says: `Cannot load native addon because loading addons is disabled`.

The solution to this is to use an alternative to the native addon which is either fully implemented in JavaScript or can be compiled to WebAssembly.
